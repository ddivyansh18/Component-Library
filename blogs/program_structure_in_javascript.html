    <h1>Program Structure In Javascript</h1>
    <p>
        Just like all programming languages, programs in JavaScript follow a definite syntax in structure and in this blog we will explore this structure.
        <br>
        This blog is based on the second chapter of book “Eloquent JavaScript” available <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html" target="_blank">here</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Expressions and Statements</h3>
    <p>
        Any part of code which produces a value is called an expression.
        <br>
Every written value is also an expression.
<br>
For ex : 25, “JavaScript”, true ;
<br>
A program is just a list of simple statements arranged to perform a complex task.
<br>
A semicolon after every statement is optional in JavaScript, but it is a good practice to use it after every statement to reduce   ambiguity and confusion.
    </p>

    <h3>Bindings</h3>
    <p>
        Bindings or variables are used to catch and hold values.
        <br>
In JavaScript, bindings are usually created using the keywords let, const and var.
<br>
For example : let one = 1, two = 2, three;
<br>
An empty binding like three in above statement, holds the value undefined.
<br>
We should avoid using var to create bindings as it has some confusing properties.
<br>
On the other hand, const is used to create constant bindings in which the variable can only hold a single value in its whole lifetime.
<br>
Reserved words called keywords can’t be used to create bindings.
    </p>

    <h3>Function</h3>
    <p>
        A function is like many statements wrapped in a single value. 
        <br>
        This single value can be applied to execute the wrapped statements.
        <br>
For example : console.log(“Hello World”) is a function that will print Hello World in the console.
    </p>

    <h3>Return Values</h3>
    <p>
        When a function produces a value using the wapped statements, it is said to return that value.
        <br>
If a function writes text to screen, it is said to produce a side effect, not every function produces side effects.
<br>
For example : Math.max(1,5) returns value 5, to print this value to screen we need to execute console.log(Math.max(1,5)) which produces a side effect.
    </p>

    <h3>Control Flow</h3>
    <p>
        In JavaScript, statements are executed line by line from top to bottom.
        <br>
We can also make some statements only execute based on certain conditions, this is called conditional execution. This is achieved using if and else statement.
<br>
The curly braces {} are used to group multiple statements into a single statement. We can also chain multiple if-else statements if required.
    </p>

    <h3>While and do-while loops</h3>
    <p>
      A loop allows us to do repetitive work easily using some simple statements.
      <br>
A statement starting with while indicates a while loop, which runs “while a condition is true”.
<br>
Do while loops on the other hand run atleast once, and are “exit controlled loops”, which means that the loop condition is checked after execution of every iteration.  
    </p>

    <h3>Indenting code</h3>
    <p>
        Indentation means adding extra spaces, tabs and empty lines in the code to make it more readable. 
        <br>
        It is a good practice to indent our code so that other people can easily read it.
    </p>


    <h3>For loop</h3>
    <p>
        It is also a type of loop just like while and do while, but the difference here is that a counter like variable to track the progress of the loop. 
        <br>
        Also the syntax contains mandatory two semicolons.
“break;” is used to instantly come out of a loop
    </p>

    <h3>Switch</h3>
    <p>
        Instead of a if else ladder sometimes it is easier to use switch-case statement.
        <br>
There are multiple case statements inside a switch statement, which can be executed based on the case label, if no case label matches then the default case is used.
<br>
It is required to use “break;” statement if we want only code related to that label to execute, in case break statement is not used, the execution goes on until a break statement is encountered.
    </p>

    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <p>
        Comments convey additional information to someone who is reading that code, comments are not executed at all, in JavaScript // is used for single line comment and /**/ is used for multiline comment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thus, we discussed a lot of programming constructs which are building blocks of every JavaScript program.
