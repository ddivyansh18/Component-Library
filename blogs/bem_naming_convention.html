    <h1>BEM Naming Convention</h1>
    <p>
        BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a naming convention for HTML and CSS classes, it is mainly used to standardize the way in which these classes are named to make them more readable
    </p>

    <h3>Block</h3>
    <p>
        In this naming convention a parent element is thought of as a block which contains child elements, in case of CSS, these child elements are more specific selectors. In BEM, parents are named as they would be named normally.
    </p>

    <h3>Element</h3>
    <p>
        On the other hand, children or elements inside parents are selected using a format of .parentName__childName, the double underscores are used for additional readability. 
    </p>

    <h3>Modifier</h3>
    <p>
        Modifiers are properties which can modify or change the appearance of the parent. In BEM, these are named using a convention like parentName—propertyName, once again the two dashes are there for additional clarity.
    </p>


    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <p>
        The advantage of using BEM is that a developer which doesn’t know about BEM before can still understand the use of various CSS classes even in case of a complex program. It can also serve as a standard that can be common between both developers and designers.
    </p>

    <h3>Criticisms</h3>
    <p>
        Some criticisms of BEM naming convention are, just like all other conventions, its use depends on the person writing it and its correct use can’t be  completely enforced like a syntax of programming language, so if someone writes class names which look like BEM but are not in practice, then it will create confusion. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, BEM can be looked as a good practice which can make CSS classes more readable, if the developer trying to implement it understands its correct usage.
    </p>
